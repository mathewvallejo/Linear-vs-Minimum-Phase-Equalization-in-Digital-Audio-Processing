# Linear-vs-Minimum-Phase-Equalization-in-Digital-Audio-Processing
This study compares IIR minimum-phase and FIR linear-phase EQs to determine when linear-phase filters introduce audible pre-ringing. Both designs are implemented in MATLAB and evaluated through objective analysis and listening tests, highlighting their respective advantages, limitations, and ideal use cases.
