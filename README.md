# Linear-vs-Minimum-Phase-Equalization-in-Digital-Audio-Processing
Abstract:
This study investigates the perceptible impact of audio equalizers (EQs) designed with infinite
impulse response (IIR) minimum-phase filtering compared to those designed with infinite
impulse response (IIR) linear-phase filtering. The purpose of the investigation is to determine the
conditions under which linear-phase FIR filters introduce audible “pre-ringing” to a processed
signal in comparison to minimum-phase IIR filters. In the process, it highlights the benefits and
use-cases of each design type, as well as the limitations inherent to each. The analysis includes a
brief literature review of relevant foundational research followed by a section on background
theory. Subsequent sections outline the mathematical underpinnings and design of two digital
EQs—one minimum-phase IIR and one linear-phase FIR—designed using minimum-phase IIR
techniques and the Parks-McClellan algorithm respectively. Both designs are implemented and
tested in MATLAB with various audio inputs.
